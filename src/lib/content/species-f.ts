Even where both sexes occur, seed is only viable for a few days and needs bare, wet, freshly deposited silt to germinate, a habitat that river engineering has almost eliminated. Almost every surviving tree is therefore a cutting of a cutting, and genetic surveys have found very few distinct clones. Conservation now means deliberately planting known female clones near males on restored floodplains.'
