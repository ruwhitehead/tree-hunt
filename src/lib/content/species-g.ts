The First World War consumed timber at a rate the country could not meet (pit props, trench boards, sleepers), and the Forestry Commission was created to make sure it never happened again. Sitka was the answer: it grew faster on poor wet upland than anything native. Tax reliefs in the 1970s and 1980s drove planting onto the deep peat of the Flow Country in Caithness and Sutherland, one of the largest blanket bogs in the world, and the resulting fight between forestry and conservation changed British land policy. Some of those plantations are now being felled and the bog deliberately restored. It is a young tree with a very loud recent history.'

That is a close match for upland Britain, which is why it produces more timber per hectare per year here than any alternative. The wood has an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio: it framed early aircraft, including the de Havilland Mosquito, and straight-grained pieces are still cut for guitar and piano soundboards. The carbon argument is genuinely two-sided. A growing plantation locks up carbon fast, but ploughing and draining deep peat to establish one can release more than the trees recover for decades, which is why planting on deep peat is now restricted.'

In Britain the lime became the avenue tree of the seventeenth and eighteenth-century estate, planted in long formal double rows to draw the eye to a house.

A mature lime in July is one of the most productive insect feeding stations in a British town. The tree itself is a hybrid of small-leaved and large-leaved lime, and it inherits vigour from both, which is why it outgrows either parent and why it is the one that got planted.'

				'Cedarwood is rich in aromatic oils that deter insects and resist fungal decay, which is exactly why it was worth shipping across the ancient Mediterranean for temples, coffins and boats, and why cedar chests still keep moths out of blankets. The species is now classed as Vulnerable. Its native range is a narrow altitude band in the mountains of Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, and a warming climate is pushing the zone it can tolerate upslope, where there is progressively less mountain to move on to; heavy goat browsing has meanwhile suppressed natural regeneration for centuries. There is an irony in the other direction: because it copes well with heat and drought, cedar of Lebanon is increasingly recommended for British planting as our own climate shifts.'

The association stuck anyway, and the weeping willow became the standard emblem of mourning on eighteenth and nineteenth-century gravestones and mourning jewellery, which is where the hybrid’s name sepulcralis comes from.

The same appetite makes its roots aggressively opportunistic: they follow moisture gradients and are notorious for finding and entering drains, soakaways and old clay pipework, which is why planting guidance keeps them well away from buildings. That thirst is also useful, and willows are widely used in phytoremediation, drawing water and dissolved contaminants out of polluted ground. Like most cultivated willows it is grown from cuttings and roots almost too easily, so the trees you see are close to genetically identical.'

In revolutionary France it became a tree of Liberty, planted in town squares partly on the pun between peuplier and peuple, and Napoleon had avenues of it set along military roads for shade.

The narrow fastigiate habit is genetic, caused by branches held at a very acute angle, and it is the entire reason the tree was propagated. The catch is that a clone is a single genotype: every Lombardy poplar shares the same susceptibilities, which is why poplar canker moves through plantings so efficiently and why the tree is now much less planted than it was.'

On a visit to Japan he was shown a painting of Taihaku, the great white cherry, and told it was extinct there; he realised he had it growing in his own garden and, after several failed attempts, succeeded in returning it to Japan in 1932. ‘Kanzan’ meanwhile became the workhorse of British post-war street planting, which is why so many ordinary roads put on a spectacular fortnight every April.'

Cherry blossom also supplies one of the longest biological records anywhere: the dates of the Kyoto flowering festival have been noted in court diaries and temple records for over 1,200 years, and that series shows a clear recent shift towards earlier flowering, with some of the earliest dates ever recorded falling in the last few decades. It is the same measurement you are making when you note first flower on your own tree.'
