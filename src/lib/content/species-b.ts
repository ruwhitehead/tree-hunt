				'Older than the church beside it',
				'Many British churchyard yews substantially pre-date their churches — the Fortingall Yew in Perthshire and the Llangernyw Yew in Conwy are both credibly over 2,000 years old, and dozens more exceed a thousand. The likeliest explanation is that early Christian sites were deliberately founded at places already sacred, and a great yew was exactly such a marker. The alternative and duller explanation — that yews were planted in enclosed ground to keep toxic foliage away from livestock, and to supply bow timber — is probably also true in some cases. Both can be right; churchyard yews are not one phenomenon.'

				'The tree of death and return',
				'Yew’s association with mortality is unusually well earned: it is highly poisonous, it grows in burial grounds, it lives longer than any other native tree, and it regenerates from apparently dead hollow trunks by dropping branches that root, so a single organism can renew itself indefinitely. Shakespeare has the witches use "slips of yew" in *Macbeth*; the "double fatal yew" of *Richard II* refers both to its poison and to the longbows made from it. Yew branches were carried at funerals and, in some parishes, laid in the grave.'
			],
			[
				'The longbow question',
				'The English longbow was made of yew, ideally with heartwood and sapwood in the same stave to combine compression and tension strength. Domestic yew was often too knotty, so vast quantities were imported — a 1472 statute required every ship trading into England to bring bow staves, and Venetian and Alpine yew stocks were seriously depleted supplying the trade. The often-repeated claim that English churchyard yews were planted specifically to supply bows is largely a later story; the imports tell the real tale.'

				'The chemotherapy tree',
				'Paclitaxel, sold as Taxol, is one of the most important cancer drugs ever developed, used against ovarian, breast and lung cancers. It was first isolated in 1967 from the bark of the Pacific yew, *Taxus brevifolia*, and works by jamming the microtubule machinery that cells use to divide. The original supply problem was severe — treating one patient took the bark of several mature trees, killing them. The solution came partly from *Taxus baccata*: 10-deacetylbaccatin III, extracted from the clippings of ordinary European yew hedges, can be converted semi-synthetically into paclitaxel. Yew hedge trimmings from British gardens and churchyards have been collected commercially for exactly this purpose.'
			],
			[
				'Poisonous in every part but one',
				'Yew contains taxine alkaloids, which are cardiotoxic and can stop the heart; foliage, bark and seed are all dangerous, and dried clippings remain toxic. The single exception is the fleshy red aril, which is sweet and harmless — an elegant piece of evolutionary engineering, since the plant needs a bird to eat the flesh and either drop or excrete the seed without chewing it. Horses and cattle are highly susceptible, which is the practical reason not to throw yew clippings over a field wall.'
			],
			[
				'Why we cannot count the rings',
				'Yews hollow from the centre as heartwood decays, and they can also fuse multiple stems, lose whole sections and regrow. That destroys the standard dendrochronological record, so ages are estimated from girth growth rates, historical records and comparison — methods that diverge wildly for very old trees. Claims of 4,000 or 5,000 years for the Fortingall Yew are unverifiable; 2,000 to 3,000 is the cautious range most specialists accept.'

				'Two needles, one machine',
				'Each pair of needles in a Scots pine grows from a single short shoot and is semicircular in section, so the two together form a cylinder. That geometry sheds water and snow, presents a small surface area to drying wind, and creates turbulence that helps gas exchange around the shoot. The thick waxy cuticle and sunken stomata reduce water loss so effectively that pines can photosynthesise in cold, dry conditions when broadleaves cannot afford to open at all — which is how the species survives from Spain to the Arctic Circle, the widest range of any pine.'

			[
				'Fire, seed and a two-year cone',
				'Scots pine is adapted to disturbance: thick insulating bark on the lower trunk survives light ground fires, seed germinates readily on bare mineral soil and burnt ground, and cones take two full years to ripen before releasing winged seed in dry spring weather. Suppressing fire and grazing heavily by deer has been the main reason Caledonian pinewood has failed to regenerate — the trees are willing; the seedlings get eaten.'

It has also been an economic product for millennia — pitch and tar for waterproofing ships, turpentine, rosin for violin bows and gymnasts’ hands. Amber is fossilised conifer resin, and the insects trapped in it are the best window we have into ancient forest ecosystems.'

Along with the taboo goes the calendar problem: the switch to the Gregorian calendar in 1752 shifted the dates by eleven days, which is why "may" blossom often is not out on the first of May.'

Hawthorn flowers emit trimethylamine, the same volatile compound produced by decomposing animal tissue, because their pollinators are flies and midges that are drawn to carrion. In the open air the scent reads as sweet and almondy; in a warm enclosed room the trimethylamine dominates. In an age when the dead were laid out at home, the association with the smell of a corpse needed no further explanation.'

				'Hawthorn is the backbone of the British hedge because it grows fast, tolerates cutting and laying, and knits into a stock-proof barrier — hence "quickthorn", from "quick" meaning living. The Enclosure Acts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries drove the planting of an estimated 200,000 miles of new hedge, overwhelmingly hawthorn, in a landscape change so vast that it is what most people now think of as timeless English countryside. Dating a hedge by counting woody species per 30-yard stretch — Hooper’s rule, roughly one species per century — works because hawthorn hedges accumulate colonists over time.'

Saponins foam in water, and conkers were genuinely used as a soap substitute; in the First World War they were collected in vast quantities by British schoolchildren as a source of starch for acetone production in cordite manufacture, a scheme that mostly failed because the conkers rotted at railway stations before they could be processed.'

		folklore: [

				'The Elder Mother',
				'Elder is the one British tree you were supposed to ask permission from. The Elder Mother — *Hylde-Moer* in Danish tradition, and widely known in England — inhabited the tree, and cutting it without asking (the formula ran roughly "Old Girl, give me some of thy wood and I will give thee some of mine when I grow into a tree") invited real misfortune. Elder was never burned indoors, never used for a cradle, and never made into a butcher’s skewer. J.K. Rowling’s Elder Wand, most powerful and most treacherous of wands, sits squarely in this tradition.'

			[
				'The guardian and the gallows',
				'Elder’s reputation is double-edged: planted by the dairy and the back door to protect the house, yet also the tree Judas was said to have hanged himself from, and the wood of the cross in some tellings. Both stories may reflect the same underlying observation — elder grows on disturbed, dunged, unclean ground, close to human mess, and so sits at the boundary between the domestic and the wild. English medicine leaned on it heavily: John Evelyn called it a remedy "against all infirmities whatever", and elder features in more folk prescriptions than any other native plant.'

				'The fire tree',
				'Elder stems have a wide core of soft pith that pushes out easily, leaving a natural tube. Those tubes were used as blowpipes to breathe life into a fire, as pop-guns and whistles by children, and as pipe stems — the Latin *Sambucus* derives from *sambuca*, a musical instrument. One plausible etymology traces "elder" itself to Anglo-Saxon *æld*, fire. The same hollow stems are now recommended as ready-made nesting tubes for solitary bees.'

			[
				'Elderberry and the immune claims',
				'Elderberry extracts are among the most commercially successful herbal remedies for colds and influenza, and the evidence is real but modest: several small randomised trials report symptoms resolving a couple of days sooner, and the anthocyanins involved do have measurable antiviral activity in vitro. The trials are mostly small, industry-funded and heterogeneous, so the honest summary is "promising, not proven". Cooking matters more than branding — raw berry preparations risk cyanogenic glycoside toxicity, so all traditional recipes boil them.'

			[
				'A tree that follows people and badgers',
				'Elder is a nitrogen-loving colonist, which makes it a reliable indicator of enrichment: it springs up on muck heaps, rabbit warrens, badger setts, gull colonies, ruins and abandoned farmyards. Archaeologists and ecologists use stands of elder as a marker of past human or animal occupation — a line of elders in scrub is often the ghost of a farmyard. Its seed is spread abundantly by birds, and it grows fast enough to fruit within four or five years before being shaded out by longer-lived trees.'
