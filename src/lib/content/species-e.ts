The strategy also explains larch’s intolerance of shade and its usefulness in forestry as a fast, light-casting nurse crop. British larch now faces *Phytophthora ramorum*, which has forced large-scale felling in the south-west and Wales since 2009 — statutory plant health notices routinely require whole compartments to be cleared.'
